# Humm Fu

Requires [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

For [Code For A Cause Micro Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/cfac-x-micro-2), theme "TINY BUT MIGHTY".

- Single-screen platformer. Avoid scrolling because I think offscreen point culling is not mitigated yet for web (MacOS clients).
- You're a tiny bird. Hold A to fly, and tap B to swing your blade of grass.
- Use one image each, for sprites and maps. Both tilesheets. 16x16px tiles, but the hero will use only a little of it.

## Timeline

- Thu 25 Sept 17:00: Begin work.
- Fri 26 Sept EOD: Hero, monsters, map loader.
- Sat 27 Sept EOD: Menus. Final maps.
- Sun 28 Sept EOD: Music. Itch page. Aim to be fully finished.

- Tue 30 Sept 12:00: Deadline. No time to work today.
